    ### Rules of PRSDigg

    PRSDigg tries to build a win-win **platform** for both **authors** and **readers**.

    We believe that the value of an article is composed of both the author and the reader, but the actual situation is that the reader's contribution, especially the early readers' contribution,is not well represented. Therefore, the biggest difference between PRSDigg and other platforms is that PRSDigg introduces an **early reader rewards** mechanism.

    The specific rules are as follows,

    1. Users can publish articles on the **platform** and become **authors**.
    2. All articles are paid articles, priced by *PressOne Token* with a minimum of 1 PRS.
    3. Users can pay for the articles, i.e. become a **reader** of a article.
    4. For every new income from an article, 40% will be allocated to each **early reader** on a pro-rata basis as **Early Reader Bonus** , 10% will be a handling fee for the **platform**, and the rest will be revenue for the **author**.
    5. **Readers** can also increase the amount they pay for an article by means of a reward in order to increase their share of the bonus.

    For example: 

    User A published an article X pricing 10 PRS on the platform. 

    User B paid 10 PRS for article X and got the right to read the article. 

    Therefore, article X earned 10 PRS, because B is the first reader and there is no earlier reader, so there is no early reader bonus; 1 PRS(10%) is used as the platform's handling fee; The remaining 9 PRS are all taken as author revenue and transferred to the account of author A.

    User C paid 10 PRS for article x after B. As a result, Article X earns another 10 PRS.

    Among them, 4 PRS(40%) will be used as an early reader bonus. At this time, there is only one early reader,  user B, so B monopolizes this 40% reward; The platform also receives 1 PRS(10%) as a handling fee; The remaining 5 PRS is the author's income. 

    After C, user D also paid 10 PRS for article X.

    Similarly, 4 PRS(40%) will be rewarded as early readers bonus. At this time, there are two early readers, namely B and C, who paid 10 PRS for article X before, so both B and C will be rewarded with `4 * 10/(10+10) = 2` PRS respectively. 

    The platform also charges 1 PRS(10%) as a handling fee; The remaining 5 PRS is the author's income. 

    And so on. 

    It is worth reminding that besides the payment for articles, the income from other payment behaviors (such as reward) will also be included in the distribution ratio of early readers' bonus.
